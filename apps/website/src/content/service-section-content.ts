    faqs: [
      {
            "question": "How do arrival, extension and residence services differ?",
            "answer": "An arrival application concerns entry. An extension concerns the stay already granted, and a residence application concerns a particular basis for living in Indonesia. Start with your current location, permit and intended activities; a longer trip does not by itself turn a visit into a residence route."
      },
      {
            "question": "Does a two-year visa mean I can stay continuously for two years?",
            "answer": "Not necessarily. A multiple-entry visa has a validity window for repeated entries, while each entry has its own stay limit. Residence permits use a different structure. Check the issued permission and its conditions; the catalogue period is not an individual stay entitlement."
      },
      {
            "question": "Can I change status inside Indonesia?",
            "answer": "An onshore change (alih status) and an extension are different procedures. The current permit, sponsor and intended new purpose determine whether a change is available. A pending request does not automatically protect an expiring stay. Have the permit and exact expiry ready before planning the transition."
      },
      {
            "question": "Are government fees, translations and family members included?",
            "answer": "The live price relates to the exact selected service. Ask for an itemised scope showing authority fees, sponsorship, translations, dependants and any additional administration. A partner or child is a separate applicant; a price check does not submit an application."

      {
            "question": "How should I choose between PT PMA and PT PMDN?",
            "answer": "Start with the shareholders and whether foreign investment is involved, then the actual activities and operating location. The chosen activities affect the ownership and licensing review. Do not choose a structure solely because it sounds simpler: the ownership, deed and business plan must describe the same operation."
      },
      {
            "question": "Does company formation include every operating licence?",
            "answer": "Formation, NIB/OSS registration and specialist permissions are separate steps. A food operation may need hygiene work, an alcohol business an excise review, and the premises their own building approvals. The quote should identify the business activities and name each licence being handled."
      },
      {
            "question": "When is a revision better than a new incorporation?",
            "answer": "Use a revision review when the existing entity will remain but its directors, shareholders, activities, address or capital will change. Bring the current deed and registrations alongside the proposed change. The review identifies which records and permissions must be updated together."
      },
      {
            "question": "What determines the setup timetable?",
            "answer": "A name or deed stage can finish before sector licences or bank onboarding. Document readiness, activity restrictions, premises and third-party decisions affect the sequence. Plan against named milestones and dependencies in the scope rather than a single promised completion date."

    faqs: [
      {
            "question": "Is NPWPD the same as corporate NPWP?",
            "answer": "No. NPWP is the national tax identity; NPWPD concerns regional tax registration. A business may need to review both depending on its activities and location. Coretax access is a national tax-account question, not proof that regional registration has been completed."
      },
      {
            "question": "Can a company with no revenue use the zero-activity return service?",
            "answer": "No revenue is only the starting point for review. Bank fees, expenses, capital movements or other transactions may still need to be reflected. Reconcile the year’s records before classifying the return; this service does not declare the company exempt from reporting."
      },
      {
            "question": "Does the company’s annual return include my personal return?",
            "answer": "They are separate taxpayers and separate filings. A director’s personal income, assets and other circumstances require their own review. List the individual and company returns explicitly in the quote, together with any monthly reporting or earlier-year corrections."
      },
      {
            "question": "Can monthly tax reporting replace BPJS or LKPM?",
            "answer": "No. Tax reporting follows taxable transactions and registration status; BPJS concerns health or employment protection; LKPM reports investment activity through OSS. Use separate calendars and receipts for each obligation. The applicable period and frequency need checking for the actual business."

    faqs: [
      {
            "question": "What should be checked before I pay a deposit?",
            "answer": "Start with the title, the person entitled to sign, encumbrances, intended land use and the proposed contract. A written review should identify missing records and conditions that need resolution. A structural inspection is separate from legal due diligence and should be scoped if it matters to the decision."
      },
      {
            "question": "Does a lease renewal clause guarantee another full term?",
            "answer": "Read the exact mechanism: an option, an agreement to negotiate and an automatic renewal are different arrangements. Review the lessor’s authority, conditions, price and enforceability. A marketing formula such as 25+25+25 years is not a substitute for the title and signed terms."
      },
      {
            "question": "What is the difference between PBG, SLF and an existing IMB?",
            "answer": "PBG concerns building approval and SLF fitness for use. Existing IMB documentation needs review against the building, its history and proposed changes; it should not simply be discarded or relabelled. The building dossier links the official SIMBG guidance for that distinction."
      },
      {
            "question": "Does forming a PT PMA resolve the property question?",
            "answer": "No. The company’s activities and ownership structure must be considered alongside the exact land right, intended use, building approvals and transaction. Formation is one component. The review should also cover governance, tax implications and the intended exit or succession arrangements."
