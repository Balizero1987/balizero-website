// =============================================================================
// kbli-pma-shape.ts — what a foreign-ownership cap MEANS, once the extremes are
// taken seriously.
//
// `kbli-pma-cap.ts` is the single resolver for the cap's VALUE, and its header
// already states the hard part:
//
//     "pma_status is unambiguous only at its two extremes. TERBATAS ('limited')
//      spans 0%, 49%, 100% and a non-percentage regime, so it can never be
//      turned into a figure."
//
// That resolver honours it. Every PRESENTER then interpolated the value into
// `Max ${cap}%` without asking whether the figure meant anything, so a range
// the data layer knows is heterogeneous was rendered as if it were uniform.
// Measured on the live site 2026-07-29, after #3186 shipped the v3 titles:
//
//   /kbli/47221  "special" → `Max special%` ×5, one of them VISIBLE body text
//                and two inside JSON-LD ("Restricted to max special% foreign
//                ownership (TERBATAS)"). `KBLIStructuredData` never checked
//                `capSpecial` — the exact recurrence `kbli-faq.ts` already
//                records as having happened once ("the visible answer handled
//                capSpecial, the JSON-LD did not").
//   /kbli/47111  cap 0    → `Max 0%` ×9, and an FAQ answer reading "capped at
//                0% … An Indonesian partner holds the remaining shares".
//   /kbli/79110  cap 100  → `Max 100%` ×7, same trailing clause — which at 100%
//                is not awkward but FALSE, in FAQPage JSON-LD that Google
//                ingests.
//
// Three codes of 1,559. The other seven TERBATAS rows (cap 49) render exactly
// right, which is the point: the formula is correct in its middle and wrong at
// both ends. So the fix is not new phrasing sprinkled per call-site — it is one
// classifier the presenters share, for the same reason `resolvePmaCap` exists:
// a rule that decides one fact belongs in ONE module.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it never reads `pma_kondisi` /
// `pma.condition`. The condition text is ungated free prose (e.g. "UMKM only");
// promoting it into a <title> or JSON-LD would be a NEW regulatory assertion on
// an indexed surface, which is precisely what `kbli-meta.ts` exists to prevent.
// The shape below is derived only from values the existing provenance gates
// already cover.

 * - `none`        — the ceiling is 0%: no foreign capital, whatever the status
 *                   label says. Outcome-identical to TERTUTUP for a PT PMA.
 * - `partial`     — a real ceiling strictly between 0 and 100. The percentage
 *                   IS the answer; this is the case the v3 formula was written
 *                   for (49% cabotage, and it reads perfectly).
 * - `full`        — the ceiling is 100%: whatever restricts this activity, it
 *                   is not a share of ownership. "Max 100%" restricts nothing.
 * - `conditional` — no usable figure at all: the special-distribution regime,
 *                   or any value that is not a finite number. Never render a
 *                   percentage for this.
