// Why a Bali block is a block — derived from the verdict, never defaulted
//
// `LicensingSection` frames the national licensing steps with "in Bali this is
// blocked for a PT PMA because …". That clause used to be a BINARY: one status
// (`CHIUSO_PMA_NO_BESAR`) was special-cased and EVERY other blocking status fell
// through to "under the 13 May 2026 moratorium". Measured on the canonical of
// 2026-07-27, blocked codes carry SIX distinct statuses, and only two of them
// are the moratorium — so 72 pages asserted a cause that was not theirs.
//
// It was not a cosmetic slip. The same sentence splices `l4_bali.reason` in
// right after the clause, and on 58 of those 72 the reason ends with
// "→ not blocked by moratorium" — so the page read, verbatim on prod:
//
//   "blocked for a PT PMA under the 13 May 2026 moratorium — OSS risk at
//    scale Besar is Menengah-Tinggi/Tinggi → not blocked by moratorium."
//
// A reader is told the cause and its denial in one breath. And the direction of
// the error matters commercially: a moratorium reads as temporary, so a
// permanent statutory reservation (a notary office is reserved to Indonesian
// citizens by UU 30/2004) reads as "wait it out", while `79110` — travel agency,
// one of the most-requested PT PMA activities in Bali — was told its closure was
// in force when the record says it is only PROPOSED.

 * bidang usaha a presidential annex allocates to Koperasi/UMKM nationwide.

 * SET rather than a "closed-sounding status" test. That status is MIXED on the
 * live catalogue: `01287` reads "closed to foreign ownership at the national
 * level", but `01111` reads "closed to PMA registration IN BALI" and `11010`
 * carries a sentence that is not a closure at all. Convicting all 68 on the

/**
 * The "Blocked in Bali" trust-bar hint on /kbli.
 *
 * It used to be one hardcoded sentence attributing the whole percentage to the
 * 13 May 2026 risk-tier moratorium: "low and medium-low-risk activities are
 * treated as closed to foreign-owned companies (PT PMA)". That is the SAME
 * over-attribution `isMoratoriumBasis` exists to prevent one surface away — the
 * per-code page was cured on 2026-07-27 and this card was missed, so the index
 * kept telling readers that the risk tier is why every blocked code is blocked.
 *
 * Two things were wrong with it, both measured on the served dataset:
 *
 *  - **Cause.** Of 518 blocked codes, 420 are moratorium-based
 *    (BLOCCATO_CLASSE_RISCHIO 372 + CHIUSO_MORATORIA_BALI 48) and **98 are
 *    not** — 68 TERTUTUP (an ownership restriction on the activity itself),
 *    17 NON_CLASSIFICABILE (we hold no licensing rows, so no Bali position can
 *    be stated), 7 CHIUSO_PMA_NO_BESAR (genuinely allocated to Koperasi/UMKM
 *    by Perpres 49/2021 Lampiran II), 2 closed by their sector's own regulator,
 *    2 scope-dependent, 2 by Bali's announced sectoral closures. That 98 is the
 *    same figure this module's own comment already names.
 *
 *    Was 407/111 with 39 CHIUSO_PMA_NO_BESAR until 2026-08-03. The old figure
 *    counted an INFERENCE, not a reservation: 32 of the 39 were closed because
 *    OSS holds no Usaha Besar scale row for them, which Permeninves/BKPM
 *    5/2025 Pasal 26(1) inverts — a PT PMA is Usaha Besar as a CONSEQUENCE of
 *    being foreign-owned, so the absence of that row says nothing about
 *    foreign ownership. Each was adjudicated against the annex; seven survived.
 *
 *  - **Rule.** Read as a rule, "low and medium-low-risk activities are treated
 *    as closed" is far wider than what we do: 405 codes carry only low or
 *    medium-low risk and 22 of them render closed under the scale status.
 *
 * So the counts are DERIVED here rather than restated in prose, and the
 * qualifier that made the old sentence honest — a working assessment, not a
 * certified legal determination — is kept verbatim. Deriving them also means
 * the sentence cannot go stale the next time the overlay moves, which is how
 * the original became wrong.
