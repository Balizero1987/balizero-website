/**
 * Second Home Studio — ALL user-visible copy for the studio, in one module.
 *
 * Content source: `COPY-DECK-studio.md` (cross-family copy seat, final
 * deck), folded into the nested structure other studio modules address by
 * dot-path key. Deck strings are used verbatim wherever the deck's flat
 * "a.b.c" keys map cleanly onto this module's structure — see the two
 * FIXED-FROM-DECK notes below for the two spots where "verbatim" had to
 * yield to the sweep test / terminology rule instead.
 *
 * Sections the deck does NOT cover (routeComparator, price, verdict
 * reasons/humanReview micro-copy, and the post-verdict TimelineView's
 * per-step title/range copy) keep their original hand-written strings —
 * see the file-level comment in the git history / delivery report for why
 * the deck's own "TIMELINE" section was NOT grafted onto timeline.ts (its
 * 7-step breakdown doesn't correspond to this module's step ids, and its
 * step 1 — "Complete your fit-check" — can't be a POST-verdict timeline
 * item since the fit-check is already done by the time this panel renders;
 * flagged for reconciliation rather than force-fit).
 *
 * Every component references keys via `getCopy("dot.path")`, never inline
 * strings. This makes `__tests__/forbidden-claims.test.ts` a complete
 * sweep: it walks every string value in COPY recursively and asserts none
 * matches the forbidden-claim patterns from SPEC-secondhome-studio-phaseB.md
 * §6, PLUS the terminology delta (never "assessment"/"certificate"/
 * "eligibility score" — always "fit-check result").
 *
 * Hard rules baked into every string here (spec §0/§6 + copy-deck deltas):
 *  - Always "state-owned (BUMN) Indonesian bank" — never "any bank".
 *  - Always "in your own name" / "your own name" for the deposit.
 *  - "non-working residency" is the only way we describe the permit's work
 *    status — never "work locally" / "work in Indonesia" in any order.
 *  - "the final decision rests with Imigrasi" appears verbatim in every
 *    verdict band body.
 *  - Never "assessment" / "certificate" / "eligibility score" — always
 *    "fit-check result" for the wizard's output.
 *  - No LPS, no BSI, no sharia, no split-deposit phrasing (the DECK's own
 *    draft tripped this — see FIXED-FROM-DECK #1 below), no guaranteed/
 *    100% approval, no automatic ITAP/permanent conversion, no "5-10 years"
 *    for base E33, no IDR 2,000,000, no E33S/E33R codes (E33E/E33F fine).
 *  - Never a price literal: the figure renders only from usePricingData.
 *  - Property route never reads as a green "qualified".
 *  - Custody step 3 keeps the withdrawal/compliance warning (copy-deck
 *    critique #2 — ownership is not unrestricted use).
 *  - Dependents: "priced in your free fit memo", never a number here.
 *
 * Tone: calm, factual, second person, no hype, no urgency, no scarcity.
