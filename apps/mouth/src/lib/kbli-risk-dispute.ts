/**
 * Codes where the gold editorial prose and the OSS record disagree on the
 * risk tier — the `/kbli/82990` disease: the licensing panel printed
 * "High (Tinggi)" from the record while the editorial two sections up said
 * "low risk at every scale", and nothing on the page admitted they disagree.
 *
 * This module does NOT detect anything. The detection (closed tier
 * vocabulary, clause-level negation/hedge/conditional/other-code guards,
 * zero-overlap AND universal-quantifier semantics) lives in
 * `scripts/kbli_filiera/gold_risk_dispute_relation.py` with its own
 * guilt/innocence corpus, and re-implementing it here would make two writers
 * of one verdict (W105). That script emits `data/kbli-risk-disputes.json`; a
 * pytest freshness check recomputes the population and fails when the
 * artifact is stale, so a NEW contradiction cannot reach the page without
 * its disclosure riding along.
 *
 * RENDER CONTRACT: the page may state the RECORD tiers (structured data),
 * the dispute `kind`, and `baliDependsOnTier` — all structured, compiler-
 * computed. It must never enumerate the editorial side's tiers — prose
 * evidence can carry junk, and a disclosure listing wrong tiers would be a
 * new client-facing lie. The artifact's `editorial_mentions` is audit
 * evidence for humans, deliberately not exposed by this reader.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED (round-3 BLOCKER: a corrupt/missing artifact used to degrade
 * to `{}` silently — every code would read as "no dispute" and the page
 * would ASSERT undisputed facts about codes the compiler had flagged
 * disputed, exactly the class of lie this module exists to prevent). A
 * missing file, unparseable JSON, or a payload without a `disputes` key now
 * THROWS at first read, naming the `--emit` command that fixes it — the
 * freshness gate (fix #1 of round 3) guarantees the artifact is always
 * present and current on any branch that can reach this code, so a throw
 * here means the checkout itself is broken, not a normal empty state.
 *
 * PER-ENTRY FAIL-CLOSED (round 4, MAJOR): the file-level checks above leave
 * a gap — a well-formed JSON payload can still carry one malformed ENTRY
 * (missing/empty `record`, missing/unknown `kind`, missing/non-boolean
 * `baliDependsOnTier`). `gold_risk_dispute_relation.py` never emits such an
 * entry — every entry it writes has a non-empty `record`, a `kind` from its
 * closed two-value set, and a boolean `baliDependsOnTier` — so an entry
 * shaped otherwise IS corruption (a hand-edit, a partial write, a future
 * compiler bug), not a normal empty state, and the old behavior of silently
 * dropping/defaulting it was the exact same class of lie the file-level
 * fail-closed above exists to prevent, just one level deeper. Each of the
 * three shapes now throws, naming the offending code and the `--emit` fix.
