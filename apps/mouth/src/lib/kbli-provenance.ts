// HARD RULES (kbli-navigator corner §4):
// - Decisions come ONLY from structured fields (`_l2_source`, `_l2_status`,
//   `per_skala_disputed_*` keys) — NEVER from substring matching on prose
//   (cicatrix #3: guard-over-match).
// - This module never authors licensing values: it only restates locators and
//   vintages the dataset already carries, or declares the gap.
